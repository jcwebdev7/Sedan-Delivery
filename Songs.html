I remember gray skies falling <br> and the miles stretched out between each side of town <br>
I had no sense of direction, just the feeling I was slowly sinking down <br>
It was midnight in the city, I can’t tell you but I knew what had begun <br>
I was thinking I was crazy for not doing what I knew I should have done <br><br>

I stood watching, remembering, with no chance to explain <br>

My time was ending on a January morning in the rain <br><br>

Have you ever been so sure you could not fall you never bothered to look down? <br>
And then sure enough you stumbled<br> and the next thing you knew, you were on the ground <br>
I threw away so much I never even knew I even had to lose <br>
I learned too late you’d never wait around for me to get things straight and choose <br><br>

I stood watching, remembering, with no chance to explain <br>

My time was ending on a January morning in the rain <br><br>

      She loaded up the kids in an old Impala station wagon <br>
Picture books, and toys won at the district fair<br>
She took a lot of pain in her life<br>
But not as much as she took in the past eight years<br>
Oh, there were so many tears<br>
<br><br>
The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore<br>
The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore<br>
<br><br>
He came home from work, walked into an empty house<br>
Well, there was still some furniture<br>
But no one else was there<br>
Sat down on the sofa<br>
Said, “My god, what has she done to me?”<br>
“Oh lord, what has she done?”<br>
<br><br>
The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore<br>
She just got up and walked right out the door<br><br>





He sat down and said to himself<br>
“Well how could she do this to me?”<br>
Like most people do when they won’t admit they’re wrong<br>
Now the kids are at her mother’s<br>
And she’s staying with her sister<br>
And she won’t go back<br>
No she won’t go back this time<br>
<br><br>
The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore<br>
The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore<br>
When pain ain’t worth the pleasure any more<br>
You just get up and walk right out the door.<br>

One look tells me all I need to know<br>
And then she asks me why I need her so<br>

And I say:<br><br>
“Ain’t no secret, baby”<br>
“Ain’t no reason that is true”<br>
“I love you like I do because I do”<br>

She walks in the room<br>

      For the sad old blue-eyed man who stayed alive <br>
Who tried and tried and tried to say goodbye<br>
Spent his years in a spiral suicide<br>
And he lost all hope when his best friend finally died<br>
<br><br>
Ah, for years his music, well, it gave me a reason<br>
Long after it had ceased to please him<br>
Hope I die before I get too old<br>
Or at least before my dreams have all been sold<br>
<br><br>
Oh, there’s nothing to believe in any more<br>
All my faith is gone, been swept right out the door<br>
The teenage wasteland’s claimed another soul<br>
There’s nothing to believe in anymore<br>
<br><br>
But maybe ah yeah it’s better anyway<br>
Cos compromise is the order of the day<br>
Still I remember leaping around the room<br>
At seventeen and growing old too soon<br>
<br><br>
Oh, there’s nothing to believe in any more<br>
All my faith is gone, been swept right out the door<br>
The teenage wasteland’s claimed another soul<br>
There’s nothing to believe in anymore<br>

That winds past nestors<br>
Rusted iron rail <br>

I hate to think<br>
What you think about me<br><br>
It’s so hard to keep myself<br>
From asking you sometimes<br>
“Do you ever think about us?”<br>
“Am I ever on your mind?”<br><br>

Cos I love you and I don’t care if you know<br>
There’s something in me that will not let go<br>

Last night I wanted you so bad <br>
I would have gone anywhere<br>
Done anything I had to <br>
Just for a taste<br>
A look<br>
A feel<br>
Of your sweet death<br>
<br><br>
Last night I saw beyond my life<br>
To what the other side is like<br>
And I remember how I almost had forgotten<br>
What a breath <br> is really for<br>
<br><br>
Oh oh, last night it hit me<br>
Oh, last night it hit me<br>
<br><br>
You took me down and almost out<br>
And now you have the nerve to come around<br>
And say that you still want me<br>
Cocaine<br>
Ohhh, cocaine<br>
I don’t want you<br>
I don’t need you<br>
I’m tired of dying<br>
Leave me alone<br>
Let me live<br>
<br><br>

Oh oh, last night it hit me<br>
Oh, last night it hit me<br>



Last night I wanted you so bad<br>
I would have gone anywhere<br>
Done anything I had to <br>
Just for a taste<br>
A look<br>
A feel<br>
Of your sweet death<br>

You say: “I’m not playing with your heart” <br>
Next thing I know, you are out that door<br>
I see nothing but the lines I read<br>
And the sound of all those things you said<br>
<br><br>
But when I look in your eyes<br>
All I see are lies<br>
These are lies<br>
Lies, I tell myself<br>
<br><br>
You say: “Time will pass, and we’ll forget<br>
And leave the past behind with no regret”<br>
You say: “Nothing’s wrong that can be right”<br>
All is lost and love must be denied<br>

      Follow my footsteps through the dark <br>
Let’s get lost together<br>
Then, let me hear the whisper of your sigh<br>
Breathe softly into mine<br>

Alone you feel you say<br>
And I can’t see just why<br>
But if you are then tell me<br>
Tell me where am I?<br>
Tell me where am I?<br>

<br><br>

Strange how the days fade into years<br>
So silently descending<br>
And if I told you what you mean to me<br>
I don’t think you’d believe<br>

      Can I call my friends parents by their first names? <br>
My reality’s so different but I’m still the same<br>
And I don’t know, where I have to go<br>
If I could light your candle, would you steal my flame?<br>
Would you steal my flame?<br>
<br><br>
And the days on the phone that never even rings<br>
Nights by myself that loneliness brings<br>
Theoretically not sad, actually not too bad<br>
I wanna talk to you about so damn many things<br>
So many things<br>
<br><br>
I’m 25 and I just can’t see<br>
All things that have happened to me<br>
Unresponsive girls, lovers just like pearls<br>
Still I gambol my life so merrily<br>
So merrily<br>
<br><br>
Correct me if I’m wrong, encourage if I’m right<br>
Don’t disown your feelings during every fight<br>
Dissatisfaction rings so true<br>
Sincerity won’t fill the bedroom on a cold winter’s night<br>
On a cold winter’s night<br>
On a cold winter’s night<br>
<br><br>
I’m 25 and I just can’t see<br>
All things that have happened to me<br>
Unresponsive girls, lovers just like pearls<br>
Still I gambol my life so merrily<br>

      When you’re out there on your own <br>
You know the world can be so cold<br>
And when things don’t turn out just like they told you<br>
Well, there’s something that I hope you know<br>
<br><br>
Everywhere that you go<br>
Every place that you might find<br>
Every time you’re feeling small<br>
Turn around, I’ll be right behind you<br>
Like a ghost from the past you can’t exorcise<br>
I’ll be there right behind you<br>
<br><br>
When `your loves have turned ice<br>
And you feel just like a washed out picture<br>
Wouldn’t it be awful nice<br>
To have someone just around the corner?<br>
<br><br>
Everywhere that you go<br>
Every place that you might find<br>
Every time you’re feeling small<br>
Turn around, I’ll be right behind you<br>
Like a ghost from the past you can’t exorcise<br>
I’ll be there right behind you<br>
<br><br>
You know that I can’t let go<br>
Never will I know I just can’t go<br>
I’ll always be right there behind you<br>
<br><br>

When you’re at your journey’s end<br>
And it seems like it just won’t be over<br>
I want you to know you’ve got a friend<br>
That you can turn to when things grow cold<br>
<br><br>
Everywhere that you go<br>
Every place that you might find<br>
Every time you’re feeling small<br>
Turn around, I’ll be right behind you<br>
Like a ghost from the past you can’t exorcise<br>
I'll be there right behind you<br>

You’ve been there, haven’t you<br>
You’re too familiar like the pictures<br>

Where ya goin? I work hard! And, anyway<br>

      I'm keeping my distance, walking the line<br>
      I'm hitting reset, stopping time<br>

I need to find you <br> but I don’t know where to look <br>
You’ve been gone so long without a trace<br>
With only rumors in your place<br>
And I miss you so much<br>
<br><br>
You’re so far away (so far away)<br>
And you feel so far, so far, so far away<br>
<br><br>
Some day I’ll find you <br> I really do believe I will<br>
But til’ then I’ll keep on prayin'<br>
No matter how I feel<br>
And I miss you so much <br>
<br><br>
But You’re so far away (so far away)<br>
And you feel so far, so far, so far away<br>

    <p class="text-light fs-2 mt-5">
In a way it seems like my life began when I met you <br>
And the day we married was the best day that I’ve known<br>
And it’s been hard for us both at times cos we’ve had to grow<br>
And you know it’s true<br>
But I can honestly say I’ve learned to love because of you<br>
<br><br>
 And tho it sounds a little strange to hear me say it<br>
The simple fact remains that it is true<br>
Tho I had many years behind me when I met you<br>
The best years of my life have been with you<br>
<br><br>
I never thought that I could love the way I love you<br>
I never knew someone could mean so much to me<br>
But dear, I swear I’d be completely lost without you<br>
I love you so much you’re the biggest part of me<br>
<br><br>
 And tho it sounds a little strange to hear me say it<br>
The simple fact remains that it is true<br>
Tho I had many years behind me when I met you<br>
The best years of my life have been with you<br>

What will the world look like when you begin to see <br>
When you open up your eyes, what will the verdict be<br>
<br><br>
Cos you were born in a world so strange<br>
You’ll see how much everything can change<br>
So I pray blessing on your life so new<br>
 And I will always be here for you<br>
Baby Angelo<br>
<br><br>
I hope you learn and don't forget<br>
This life is precious, life is a gift<br>
Right now you listen to me sing<br>
You never know what tomorrow brings<br>
So I pray blessing on your life so new<br>
And I will always be here for you, Baby Angelo<br>

What if this was the last day of your life? <br>
What would you do different <br> than what you’re doing now<br>
If this was your last day<br>
<br><br>
Would you be sad <br> or would you be grateful<br>
For the time you’ve had <br> and the life you lived<br>
Would you regret <br> the things left undone<br>
Or just accept <br> the hand you’ve been dealt<br>

Would it matter <br> what you’ve accomplished<br>
Would you be satisfied <br> or would you feel denied<br>
Of what you think <br> this life still owes you<br>
Or would you hang <br> your head in shame<br>
If this was your last day<br>

What if this was the last day of your life?<br>
What if this was the last day of your life?<br>
What if this was the last day of your life?<br>
What if this<br>

Well, it’s times like this that make me want to list all of the reasons <br>
And reason out the things that keep me hangin’ on<br>
Cos time and time again I find that nothing really matters<br>
And I open up my eyes to find me standing in the light  of another day<br>
Can’t think of anywhere else I’d rather be <br> and anyway the options aren’t so great <br>
I’m glad to be here, you know I’m really glad to be here today<br>
Because anywhere has got to be <br> better than nowhere<br>
<br><br>
And it’s times like this that make me want to stand up on my bed<br>
And shout to all the world that I’m still hanging on<br>
Cos time and time again I find that nothing really matters<br>
And I open up my eyes to find me standing in the light of another day<br>
Can’t think of anywhere else I’d rather be <br> and anyway the options aren’t so great<br>

I will always remember the way you looked that night <br>
And I swear I’ve thought about it<br>
At least a million times<br>
<br><br>
What if I never saw you?<br>
And what if we never met?<br>
Well, in that case I’d have nothing<br>
Nothing to forget<br>
<br><br>
I was searching for salvation<br>
I was fleeing from the past<br>
But when I saw you, I felt suddenly alive<br>
It was the last thing I expected<br>
Yeah, it took me by surprise<br>
When I turned and saw eternity in your eyes<br>
<br><br>
What if I never saw you?<br>
And what if we never met?<br>
Well, in that case I’d have nothing<br>
Nothing to forget<br>

Everywhere there’s Christmas cheer <br>
And yet it’s hard to care this year<br>
Cos it’s clear we ain’t going nowhere<br>
Without the fear of dying out there<br>
<br><br>

It’s gonna be a lockdown Christmas<br>
There ain’t no ho ho ho<br>
Gonna be a lockdown Christmas<br>
To grandma’s you don’t go<br>
<br><br>

It’s gonna be a lockdown Christmas<br>
Can’t find nothing in the store<br>
Gonna be be a lockdown Christmas<br>
Cos the virus won the war<br>
<br><br>

No need for lights or a big old tree<br>
No one’s coming over, no one’s gonna see<br>
Can’t find no reason to get in my car<br>
Ain’t going to the mall, ain’t going to a bar<br>
<br><br>

It’s gonna be a lockdown Christmas<br>
And Santa’s sled is gonna crash<br>
Gonna be be a lockdown Christmas<br>
Cos Rudolph’s wearing a mask.<br>
